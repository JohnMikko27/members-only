# Members-only

[Live Demo](https://members-only-johnmikko27.up.railway.app/)

This is a project from The Odin Project curriculum users can signup/login and create messages, but if they're not part of the club, they won't be able to see who created these messages. To be part of the club, they have to enter the secret key.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Passport.js
- Pug (Jade)
- CSS

## I learned

- How to utilize Passport.js to ensure persistent auth throughout different routes
- How to utilize Passport.js with bcrypt and Node/Express to create a signup/login/auth functionality
- How to deploy an Express app using Railway

## Deployment

Deployed using Railway

## Future additions

I plan to improve the CSS in the future. I only added basic styling because I just wanted to make sure that the actual functionality of the app was working
